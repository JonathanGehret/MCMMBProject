# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Study area: West New Guinea (Papua & Papua barat)

![**Fig. 1.** The study area of Western New Guinea](images/study_area.png){width="100%"}

Papua & Papua barat

Papua and Papua Barat are both provinces of Indonesia on the western part of the island of new guinea. The island is the second largest in the world and is geographically counted as part of Australia. An extremely high biodiversity can be found here. This is due to the intact rainforests, the mangrove swamps in the south and the coral reefs. The island was formed due to plate tectonic movement (pacific plate under the Indian-Australian plate). Therefore, the island is crossed by the Maoke Mountains and has a height of 4884 m with the Puncak Jaya. The highest population density is reached on the coasts, the mountainous areas are rather sparsely populated. <http://www.papuaweb.org/>

In 1660 they were part of the dutch new guinea colony and got concurred and occupied by the dutch east India company. This colony got attacked by the Indonesian military in 1961, with the purpose of the reunition of the corelated tribes. With the mediation of the united nations and a referendum of the residents (act of choice) Papua and papua barat became part of Indonesia. <https://pm20.zbw.eu/category/geo/i/141619/> <https://gis.dukcapil.kemendagri.go.id/peta/>

# 2. Theory

# 2. Methods

For the creation of this HTML document, the MCMMB.Rmd was knitted. 

To find the species to be used for our analysis we used the loops in *bird_plot_loops.R* to plot all species from the Gbif and IUCN data sets to find birds with sufficient observation points and different ranges to be used for our project.

**Fig. X.** Excerpt of the plotted maps for finding suitable species, containing the Pachycephala Genus; IUCN (left), GBIF (right) 

## 2.1. Main script

The required libraries and the setup of the IUCN and GBIF data sets are done in the *MCMMB_Main.R* script. For the IUCN data, the dataset was provided beforehand. It is read in here and named *birdlife*. Additionally a dataframe including all 555 species names that appear in the birdlife dataset was created. A shapefile containing the extent of the observation area is read in and named *regio*.
```{r main, results = FALSE, cache = FALSE}
source("MCMMB_Main.R")
```
The GBIF data were downloaded manually beforehand from the website, however the r library *rgbif* could be used instead. After cleaning up the GBIF data by only retaining the important columns of gbifID, species names and coordinates using *select()* and removing all data points without coordinates, spatial points are created from the data. These are then cropped to the observation area by use of *regio*. Of these, only species with more than 100 occurrences are kept. The names of those species are added to the *species* object.

```{r filter_example, eval = FALSE}
# example code from MCMMB_Main.R for filtering out all species with less than 100 occurences
gbif_crop = gbif_crop_all %>% group_by(species) %>% filter(n() >= 100 ) %>% ungroup()
```

## 2.2. Species data

The script species_loops.R includes two functions each for creating lists with the input bird species data for GBIF (*get_gbif_birds(bird_names,gbif_crop,regio*) and IUCN (*get_iucn_birds(bird_names,birdlife,regio*) and plotting them, respectively. IUCN birdlife data is depicted in red, GBIF points in green. The *gbif_birds* list contains the GBIF observation points for the selected species, which are then used for the creation of pseudo-absence data and further for the creation of the SDMs. The resulting *iucn_birds* list is only used again for the final comparison of calculated SDMs with IUCN birdlife data.

```{r species_loops, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 10}
# loading of the described functions
source("species_loops.R")

# cassowaries didn't have enough data
#bird_names = c("Casuarius bennetti", "Casuarius casuarius", "Casuarius unappendiculatus")

# we chose Pachycephala instead
bird_names = c("Pachycephala lorentzi", 
               "Pachycephala meyeri", 
               "Pachycephala schlegelii",
               #"Pachycephala simplex", # this species doesn't appear in the birdlife data set on the island
               "Pachycephala soror")

# these names can be changed to any other bird species occuring in the data sets, for fully automated creation of sdms following this markdown file:
# bird_names = c(your_favorite_species_here)

# for plotting GBIF data next to IUCN data
par(mfrow = c(2,length(bird_names)))

# create list with birds out of the IUCN and GBIF data and plot them
iucn_birds = get_iucn_birds(bird_names,birdlife,regio)
gbif_birds = get_gbif_birds(bird_names,gbif_crop,regio)
```

**Fig. X.** The IUCN birdlife distribution ranges for the four selected species in blue. The GBIF observation data in red.

## 2.3. Create presence-absence data

While *biomod2* also brings with it capabilities to create pseudo-absence data, we built a script to do it, following the tutorial of the MCMMB lecture. First a raster grid of the region was needed, which was created by masking the elevation layer (compare 2.4.) over the regio shapefile of the observation area. From this mask centroids in the WGS84 projection were created. Based on these centroids the newly evoked *presence_absence_list* is populated by use of a for loop. As the creation of the pseudo-absence data is chance-based, a seed was set. For every species included in the *gbif_birds* list handed over to *create_pseudo_absence* function, the pseudo-absence data is created at the randomly located centroids. The number of absence points is set equal to the number of presence points. These data points are then plotted with the real presence data, colored in green and red respectively. As a result the *presence_absence_list* is returned.

```{r pres_abs_ex, eval = FALSE}
# example from presence_absence.R showcasing the creation of pseudo absences by use of the earlier created centroids (centroids_all) and the occurence data mapped to the centroids (centroids_occ) and combining both
presence_absence = rbind(centroids_all[sample(nrow(centroids_all),nrow(centroids_occ), replace = TRUE),],
                         centroids_occ)
```


    "Be sure to take care when considering the use of pseudo-absences versus true absences for species distribution
    modeling. Similarly, it is extremely important to consider the influence of sampling bias in the data used to
    train models. Further reading: e.g., Guillera-Arroita et al. 2015, Kramer-Schadt et al. 2013, and Merow et al
    2013."

```{r presence_absence, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 10}
# load presence_absence.R script including the function
source("presence_absence.R")
par(mfrow = c(1,length(bird_names)))
presence_absence_list = create_pseudo_absence(regio,gbif_birds)
```

**Fig. X.** The centroids of the created pseudo-absence data (green) and the GBIF presence data (red) for the selected species.

## 2.4. Indicators

The *Indicator.R* script is used to read in data for the various indicators (precipitation, elevation, landcover, primary_forest, temperature, human population) to be used for the SDM. These are then cropped to the target region and saved in *.tif* format in the folder *data/indicator_stack/* for later use. As the process for some of the bigger files takes a lot of time, ready to use indicator *.tif* files are to be found in the aforementioned folder. These will then be loaded and stacked later on before the SDM creation.

```{r indicator, eval = FALSE}
# where all the predictors are loaded in
source("Indicator.R")
```

```{r predictor_stacking}
# stacking all predictors found in folder indicator stack in .tif format
# predictors: elevation, precipitation, temperature, primary forest, landcover, population
tif_predictors = stack(list.files(path = "data/indicator_stack/",
                                full.names = TRUE,
                                pattern = ".tif"))
plot(tif_predictors)
```

**Fig. X.** The used predictor data: Elevation with height in m, Human Population in XXXX??, land cover in over 20 different categories (noticeably XXXX), Precipitation in XXXX, Primary forest density and temperature in °C.

## 2.5. Species distribution models

The following was done closely following the script by @griffith2017.

The script *sdm_biomod2.R* contains a function *calculate_sdm* which will calculate and return SDMs for any given presence absence data made of spatial points and stacked predictors in the *.tif* format. Various helper lists are created for storing the various outputs calculated in the function. There's also the option to change the settings for any of the used SDM methods, i.e. the GAM *k* value was changed to four, as the default one created an error message and four is a generally used value. Taking these input data, the function then iterates over every species handed to it by the following steps: First the input data is formatted by combining it into one object *format_bm*.

```{r sdm, results='hide'}
# loading BIOMOD script and passing models to test_sdms
source("sdm_biomod2.R")
gbif_sdms = calculate_sdm(presence_absence_list, tif_predictors)
```

These combined data are then called by *BIOMOD_Modeling()*, where the desired models can be set, as well as the earlier decided upon BIOMOD options are taken in. The option for splitting off validation data can also be set here, as well as the option to save the models. In this work the models GLM, GAM, ANN and RF were used. Alternative available methods can be shown using *BIOMOD_ModelingOptions()*.

```{r biomod_modeling, eval = FALSE}
# not to be executed example code taken from sdm_biomod2.R for creation of the SDMs
biomodels_1 = BIOMOD_Modeling(data = format_bm,
                            models = c('GLM','GAM','ANN','RF'),
                            SaveObj = TRUE,
                            models.options = myBiomodOptions,
                            # DataSplit = 80, # could be used for validation data
                            VarImport = 1)
```

Once these models have been calculated and put into *biomodels_1*, some further operations are available: The variable importance can be calculated (compare 3.2.), the models can be put together into an ensemble model using *BIOMOD_EnsembleModeling()*. This is done with a variable threshold of 0.6 for the predictors. For visualization purposes, the SDMs can also be projected by use of *BIOMOD_Projection()*, taking into account again the predictors of the observation area. Alternatively other areas with their respective predictors could be used to test the models on. The models, the variance importance, the ensemble models and the projections are returned by the function in the *output_list*.

# 3. Results

## 3.1. Evaluations

    "We will focus TSS (see Allouche et al. 2006 for a comparison of all three). TSS is the sum of the rates that
    we correctly classified presences and absences, minus 1. Higher is better (in the range -1 to 1), and represents
    a balance between model maximizing sensitivity and specificity." Griffith (2017)

## 3.2. Variance importance

    "We can also calculate variable importances to compare influences of individual predictor variables within and
    among models. For a publication, you might also create partial dependence plots. Do the different models
    agree on the importance of the variables?" Griffith (2017)
    
The bar plots displaying the variance importance show remarkable variations between different species and different models. Depending on the model used, the results vary considerably: While elevation in almost all cases appears to be the most important predictor, other predictors like temperature and rainfall can also have significant impact on the modelled distribution range. Land cover and primary forest generally didn’t have a lot of impact. Noticeable is also the difference between some approaches in weighting the predictors, as temperature is weighted more highly by GLM in some cases, while the other approaches prefer elevation. This consequently shows in the depiction of the computed SDMs (see 3.3.). 

```{r var_imp, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 10, fig.width = 10}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
# plotting variance importance plots
for (i in 1:length(bird_names)) {
  attributes(gbif_sdms[["var_imp"]][[names(gbif_birds[i])]])[["dimnames"]][[1]] = c("EV", "Pop", "LC", "Prec", "PF", "Temp")
  barplot(height = t(gbif_sdms$var_imp[[i]]),
          beside = T,
          horiz = T,
          main = bird_names[i],
          xlab = "Variable Importance",
          legend = c("GLM", "GAM", "ANN", "RF"))
}
```

**Fig. X.** Variable importances for the different model approaches and species. Temperature (Temp), primary forest (PF), precipitation (Prec), land cover (LC), population density (Pop) and Elevation (EV) are decpicted.

## 3.3. SDM plots

    "In order to visualize the model outputs, we should now use the SDMs to predict species occurrence across
    space using our modern environmental data. The models predict probabilities of occurrence, and it is
    important to remember the interpretation of these outputs depend on the specific model, our data, and our
    assumptions (e.g., see discussion of Maxent outputs in Merow et al 2013)." Griffith (2017)
    
The plots of the SDMs show what the variable importances already suggest: the different models have at times greatly varying discrepancies in their predicted distribution areas. The legend indicates high confidence with higher values, dark green being the most sure the model can be and light beige being less confident. While the different models mostly agree on P. lorentzi appearing almost exclusively in the central mountain ranges, the other species have a more varying predicted range, reaching up to Papua Barat. The marked areas especially in northern Papua Barat and the central mountain ranges are quite striking.

```{r sdm_proj, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 10, echo = FALSE}
# plotting all sdms
for (i in  1:length(bird_names)) {
  # for visualisation, the projected names are renamed, and then reset for further use in ensemble creation
  bird_name = bird_names[i]
  model_names = gbif_sdms[["sdm_proj"]][[bird_name]]@models.projected
  gbif_sdms[["sdm_proj"]][[bird_name]]@models.projected = c("GLM", "GAM", "ANN", "RF")
  # saved plots separately in folder plots which are plotted afterwards, for formatting reasons, also works without
  png(file = paste0("plots/", strsplit(bird_name, split = " ")[[1]][1],"_", strsplit(bird_name, split = " ")[[1]][2],".png"))
  plot(gbif_sdms$sdm_proj[[i]])
  dev.off()
  gbif_sdms[["sdm_proj"]][[bird_name]]@models.projected = model_names 
}
```

## 3.4. Ensemble plots

    "One approach for using the information in these various models is to combine them into an ensemble, or
    collection of models merged together (Thuiller et al. 2009). We can take all models above a given “quality”
    threshold and combine them." Griffith (2017)
    
The Ensemble plots are put together from the other SDMs above a threshold of 0.6 in the variable importance section. 

```{r ensemble, echo = FALSE, results='hide', fig.keep='all', fig.show="hold", out.width="50%"}
# plotting for the ensemble models
for (i in 1:length(bird_names)) {
  bird_name = bird_names[i]
  png(file = paste0("plots/", strsplit(bird_name, split = " ")[[1]][1],"_", strsplit(bird_name, split = " ")[[1]][2],"_ensemble.png"))
  plot(BIOMOD_EnsembleForecasting(EM.output = gbif_sdms$ensemble[[i]],
                                  projection.output = gbif_sdms$sdm_proj[[i]],
                                  selected.models = 'all'))
  #plot(iucn_birds[[i]], add = T, col =  rgb(red = 0, green = 0, blue = 1, alpha = 0.3))
  dev.off()
  }

**Fig. X.** Ensemble plots for the four species; Greener color means higher confidence that the birds occur in that area. The charts to the top and the right show a relative amount of how much of the land cover in that height/length are covered with predictions.

## 3.5. Comparison SDMs and IUCN

Overlaying the calculated SDMs with the range maps received from IUCN birdlife shows varying degrees of overlap, depending on species and model used. Some example cases include the GLM (and the very similar looking ANN) for P. lorentzi, which overlap completely with the IUCN range data, only the modelled area is a lot smaller than what was expected in the birdlife data. In other cases, such as P. meyeri, all of the models predict a much larger range, specifically also in the central mountains, than IUCN which shows they only appear at the northernmost area of Papua Barat. P. schlegelii and P. soror Birdlife populations are fragmented, which is als the case for the modelled SDMs, only it is very hit and miss where the areas overlap and where they don’t.


```{r sdm_iucn, echo = FALSE, out.width = "150%"}
# compare GBIF SDMs with IUCN for all birds j and SDMs i
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
for (j in 1:length(bird_names)) {
  bird = gbif_sdms$sdm_proj[[j]]
  sdms = bird@proj@val@layers
  #bird_names = names(test_sdms[j])
  for (i in 1:length(sdms)) {
    sdm = sdms[[i]]
    plot(sdm, main = paste(bird_names[j], strsplit(names(sdm@data), split = "_")[[1]][4]))
    plot(iucn_birds[[j]], add = T, col =  rgb(red = 0, green = 0, blue = 1, alpha = 0.3))
  }
}
```

**Fig. X.** The calculated SDMs GLM, GAM, ANN and RF are overlaid with the light blue IUCN range maps.

## 3.6. Comparison ensemble SDMs and IUCN

The Ensemble/IUCN comparison is analogous to the previous section. The depictions are a combination of the other SDMs.

```{r ensemble_iucn, results='hide', echo = FALSE, out.width = "150%"}
# compare GBIF ensemble SDMs for all species
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
for (i in 1:length(bird_names)) {
  sdm_ensemble = BIOMOD_EnsembleForecasting(EM.output = gbif_sdms$ensemble[[i]],
                                            projection.output = gbif_sdms$sdm_proj[[i]],
                                            selected.models = 'all')
  sdm = sdm_ensemble@proj@val
  plot(sdm, main = paste(bird_names[i], "ensemble"))
  plot(iucn_birds[[i]], add = T, col =  rgb(red = 0, green = 0, blue = 1, alpha = 0.3))
}

```

**Fig. X.** The ensemble models are overlaid with the light blue IUCN range maps.
