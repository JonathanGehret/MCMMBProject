# MCMMBProject
Project for the course **Modern Concepts and Methods in Macroecology and Biogeography** in the Master of Science of Forest Ecosystem Sciences, Study track Ecosystem Analysis and Modelling, answering the questions:
- How do IUCN Range maps of birds compare to SDMs in Indonesian New Guinea? 
- What are the main predictors for this distribution?

## Summary
Working with R, during the project, range maps of bird distribution were collected from IUCN. Location data of where birds have been observed were collectd from GBIF.

Further, predictors such as elevation, precipitation and habitat conservation status were collected from various sources.

Applying various models, range maps for these species are preadicted based on the observation data and the predictors by using the `biomod2` libaray in R, and these are then compared to the original range maps.
